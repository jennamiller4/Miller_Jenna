My name is Jenna Miller, and I am very excited to be doing a Master's of Science in Reproductive and Developmental Sciences! :smile:

My project involves developing a novel mouse model for endometriosis. The model will express the cancer-driver mutation, KRAS, which will contribute to our knowledge of how such somatic mutations may contribute to the proliferation of endometrial tissue, as well as the neurogenesis that causes pelvic pain.

In this course, I hope to become more comfortable using R and to gain more experience applying statistical methods to scientific data. 

This repository will contain my work for STAT540
